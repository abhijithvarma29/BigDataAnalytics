# Big_Data_Analytics

A collection of PySpark projects and notebooks demonstrating key techniques in big data analysis, transformation, and exploration.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1.PySpark_Even_Number_Filter` | Sample notebook to filter even numbers using PySpark transformations |
| `2.PySpark_Student_Data_Analysis_with_RDDs` | Analysis of student datasets using RDDs |
| `3.Exploring_and_Transforming_Data_with_PySpark_DataFrames` | Data exploration & transformation using DataFrames |
| `4.Basic_Operations_on_PySpark_DataFrames` | Illustrative basic DataFrame operations (select, filter, etc.) |
| `5.Data_Sampling_in_PySpark_DataFrames` | Techniques and examples of sampling large datasets |
| `6.Performing_Analytical_Operations_in_PySpark` | Analytical tasks (aggregations, grouping, window operations) |
| `Road Accidents Data Analysis.(Mini Project)` | Mini‑project analyzing Road Accidents datasets |

## 🚀 Purpose & Goals

This repository aims to:

1. Serve as a hands‑on guide to applying PySpark for real‑world data processing tasks.  
2. Illustrate the differences between RDD vs DataFrame APIs.  
3. Provide end‑to‑end examples, from raw data ingestion and transformation to analytical insights.  
4. Enable learners to adapt and expand upon the notebooks for their own datasets and experiments.

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

- **PySpark**: Apache Spark's Python API — the primary library throughout this repository  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment to combine code, results, and narrative  
- **Python 3.x**: Core language for writing scripts and notebooks  
- (Optional) Additional libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc., may be used in supporting analyses

## 📋 Prerequisites & Setup

To run the notebooks locally, you’ll need:

1. **Java** (version 8 or higher) — required by Spark  
2. **Apache Spark** installed, or alternatively use an all-in-one distribution like `pyspark` via pip  
3. **Python 3.x** with dependencies installed (e.g. `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.)  

Here’s a sample setup (assuming Unix / Linux / macOS environment):

```bash
# Install PySpark via pip (this brings in Spark + its dependencies)
pip install pyspark

# (Optional) install other useful packages
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

Then launch Jupyter Notebook in the repository directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open any `.ipynb` file from the root directory, and you’re ready to execute the examples.

## 🧪 Usage & What’s Inside

Each notebook is self‑contained:

- It begins with setup (imports, Spark session initialization)  
- Then demonstrates one or more tasks (filtering, transformation, sampling, analysis, etc.)  
- Important configurations and design decisions are annotated in markdown cells  
- You can adapt the paths, data sources, or logic as needed for your own datasets

For example, in *“Road Accidents Data Analysis (Mini Project)”*, you will:

- Load Road Accidents dataset(s)  
- Clean and preprocess data  
- Perform aggregations, visualizations, and insights extraction  

## 🛠️ Extending & Contributing

You are free to:

- Add new notebooks (e.g. time‑series forecasting, advanced streaming tasks)  
- Improve or optimize existing examples  
- Add sample datasets, visualizations, or markdown explanations  

If you contribute:

- Follow consistent naming conventions  
- Provide comments and explanations  
- Ensure any added notebooks run without errors (or mention prerequisites)
